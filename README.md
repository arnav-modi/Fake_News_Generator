# Fake_News_Generator
A simple Python-based Fake News Generator that creates fun and fictional news headlines by randomly selecting words from text files.
This project was built purely for practice and learning purposes.
# Project Description
The Fake News Generator reads data from multiple .txt files containing subjects, actions, and objects/places/things.
Each time the program runs, it randomly selects one entry from each file and combines them to form a meaningful but fake news sentence.
# Working
~The program reads data from:
    subjects.txt, actions.txt, place_or_thing.txt
~Each file contains one entry per line.
~The random module selects one line from each file.
~The selected words are combined to form a fake news headline.
